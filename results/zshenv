setopt AUTOCD

# Of course, it is much more useful with settings for =$CD PATH=.
#   However, it takes the full path of the directory and that isn't
#   that helpful, so we'll leave cdpath pretty much alone:

cdpath=( . ~ )

# The following makes cd = pushd

setopt AUTOPUSHD

# When you type in things, being case insensitive sounds like a good
#   idea:

setopt NO_CASE_GLOB
setopt NO_CASE_MATCH
setopt EXTENDEDGLOB

# I don't like every tab on my terminal sharing the same history.

setopt NO_SHARE_HISTORY
setopt APPEND_HISTORY

# Call the Profile

#   Machine specific information (like environment variable
#   information) should be stored in the =~/.profile=. I thought that
#   Zshell automatically sourced that, but it appears not.
