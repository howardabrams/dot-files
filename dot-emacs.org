#+TITLE:  Emacs Configuration File
#+AUTHOR: Howard Abrams
#+EMAIL:  howard.abrams@gmail.com

This is my =.emacs= file, written using [[http://www.orgmode.org][org-mode]], so that I can
organize it and take notes on all the complexity.

  - The =tab= key opens/close a particular section
  - Shift + =tab= cycles between the outline and full text
  - Render it with:  =C-c C-v t=
  - Creates a file:  =~/.emacs-ext.el=
  - Load it during from the =.emacs= file, like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ;; Load our Literate Programming version of our Dot Emacs
  ;; file, from file: ~/Dropbox/emacs.d/dot-emacs.org
  (load-file "~/.emacs-ext.el")
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Introduction

  This file is really a /script/ that generates my Emacs configuration
  file. For all of this to work, you need version 24 (or at least,
  version 23, like [[http://aquamacs.org/][Aquamacs]]). Pick [[https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port][Yamamoto Mitsuharu's version]]!

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <p>
    You can download the <a href="dot-emacs.org">original org-mode
    file</a> or view the <a href="dot-emacs.el">tangled end results</a>.
  </p>
#+END_HTML

  We begin this initialization script with a warning not to edit the
  generated file:

#+NAME: Note
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :comments off
  ;;; ------------------------------------------
  ;;; Do not edit the generated file, as it has
  ;;; been generated, as a tangled file, by the
  ;;; fandifluous org-mode.
  ;;;
  ;;; Source: ~/Dropbox/dot-files/emacs.org

** Initializing a New Emacs

   Emacs already comes bundled to edit most files, like Java and Ruby.
   However, some of the new stuff that I use isn't bundled, yet.

   Before this startup file can run, we need to initialize a clean
   Emacs instance by: =load-file ~/.emacs.d/init.el=
   This file is created by [[file:emacs-init.org][emacs-init.org]].

* General Settings

** Extra Packages

   Extra packages not available via the package manager go in my
   personal stash at: =$HOME/.emacs.d=

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/")
#+END_SRC

** Package Manager

   Emacs has become like every other operating system, and now has a
   [[http://tromey.com/elpa/][package manager]] with its own collection of repositories. Of
   course, now, instead of trying to figure out and maintain
   packages, we have to keep track of what packages live on what
   repos. This is [[http://batsov.com/articles/2012/02/19/package-management-in-emacs-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/][an improvement]].

   *NB:* We want to add the [[http://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade repository]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ; (load "~/.emacs.d/elpa/package.el") Needed for version 23 only!
  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives '(("org"       . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                           ("gnu"       . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                           ("melpa"     . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")
                           ("tromey"    . "http://tromey.com/elpa/")
                           ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")))
#+END_SRC

   While we can now do a =package-list-packages=, you can install and
   everything is good, however, we can't =require= any of these
   packages (in order to customize them in this file) until we do
   this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

** Variables

   General settings about me that other packages can use. The biggest
   problem is guessing my email address based on what computer I am using:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (if (equal "habrams" user-login-name)
      (setq user-mail-address "habrams@gilt.com")
    (setq user-mail-address "howard.abrams@gmail.com"))
#+END_SRC

*** Tabs vs Spaces

   I have learned to distrust tabs in my source code, so let's make
   sure that we only have spaces.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
  (setq tab-width 2)
#+END_SRC

** Font Settings

   I love syntax highlighting.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (global-font-lock-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

   Specify the default font as =Source Code Pro=, which should already
   be [[http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html][downloaded]] and installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (set-default-font "Source Code Pro")
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Source Code Pro" :height 140)
  (set-face-font 'default "Source Code Pro")
#+END_SRC

   While I do like the =Anonymous Pro= font (and usually have it download and
   installed), I don't like it as much.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
  (set-default-font "Anonymous Pro")
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Anonymous Pro" :height 140)
  (set-face-font 'default "Anonymous Pro")
#+END_SRC

** Line Numbers

   Do you want line numbers on the left side:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (line-number-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Color Theme

   We use the color theme project and followed [[http://www.nongnu.org/color-theme/][these instructions]].
   We now can do =M-x color-theme-<TAB> RET=

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'color-theme)
#+END_SRC

   The color themes work quite well, except they don't know about the
   org-mode source code blocks, so we need to set up a couple
   functions that we can use to set them.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun org-src-color-blocks-light ()
    "Colors the block headers and footers to make them stand out more for lighter themes"
    (interactive)
    (custom-set-faces
     '(org-block-begin-line 
      ((t (:underline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF"))))
     '(org-block-background
       ((t (:background "#FFFFEA"))))
     '(org-block-end-line
       ((t (:overline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF")))))

     ;; Looks like the minibuffer issues are only for v23
     ; (set-face-foreground 'minibuffer "black")
     ; (set-face-foreground 'minibuffer-prompt "red")
  )
  
  (defun org-src-color-blocks-dark ()
    "Colors the block headers and footers to make them stand out more for dark themes"
    (interactive)
    (custom-set-faces
     '(org-block-begin-line 
       ((t (:foreground "#008ED1" :background "#002E41"))))
     '(org-block-background
       ((t (:background "#111111"))))
     '(org-block-end-line
       ((t (:foreground "#008ED1" :background "#002E41")))))
  
     ;; Looks like the minibuffer issues are only for v23
     ; (set-face-foreground 'minibuffer "white")
     ; (set-face-foreground 'minibuffer-prompt "white")
  )
#+END_SRC

   My main reason for wanting to use the color theme project is to
   switch between /black on white/ during the day, and /white on
   black/ at night.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun color-theme-my-default ()
    "Tries to set up a normal color scheme"
    (interactive)
    (color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-day)
    (org-src-color-blocks-light))
  
  ;; During the day, we use the "standard" theme:
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> d") 'color-theme-my-default)
  
  ;; A good late-night scheme that isn't too harsh
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> l") (lambda () (interactive)
                                   (color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties)
                                   (org-src-color-blocks-dark)))
  
  ;; Programming late into the night
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> m") (lambda () (interactive)
                                   (color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-bright)
                                   (org-src-color-blocks-dark)))
  
  ;; Too harsh? Use the late night theme
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> n") (lambda () (interactive)
                                   (color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-night)
                                   (org-src-color-blocks-dark)))
#+END_SRC

** Macintosh

   I like the ability to use the Command key to turn a standard Emacs
   into a more Macintosh-specific application. (See [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/162896/emacs-on-mac-os-x-leopard-key-bindings][these online notes]])

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (when (eq system-type 'darwin)
    ;; Aquamacs-specific code:
    (when (boundp 'aquamacs-version)
      (global-set-key [(alt k)] 'nlinum-mode))
    
    ;; Emacs on Mac specific code:
    (unless (boundp 'aquamacs-version)
      ;; Since I already have Command-V for pasting, I
      ;; don't need Ctrl-V to do that, so disable CUA:
      (cua-mode -1)
      
      (require 'mac-key-mode)
      (mac-key-mode 1)
      
      (define-key mac-key-mode-map [(alt +)] 'text-scale-increase)
      (define-key mac-key-mode-map [(alt _)] 'text-scale-decrease)
      (define-key mac-key-mode-map [(alt l)] 'goto-line)
      (define-key mac-key-mode-map [(alt w)] 'delete-single-window)
      (define-key mac-key-mode-map [(alt k)] 'nlinum-mode)))
#+END_SRC

   I would like Command-W to close a frame, but only if it only has a
   single window in it. I found this code on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/frame-cmds.el][this site]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun delete-single-window (&optional window)
    "Remove WINDOW from the display.  Default is `selected-window'.
  If WINDOW is the only one in its frame, then `delete-frame' too."
    (interactive)
    (save-current-buffer
      (setq window (or window (selected-window)))
      (select-window window)
      (kill-buffer)
      (if (one-window-p t) 
          (delete-frame) 
          (delete-window (selected-window)))))
#+END_SRC


** More Key Definitions

   I like the ability to move the current line up or down by just
   doing =S-M-up= and =S-M-down= (just like in Eclipse):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (load-library "line-move")
#+END_SRC

** Recent File List

   According to [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-es/RecentFiles][this article]], Emacs already has the recent file
   listing available, just not turned on.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'recentf)
  (recentf-mode 1)
  (setq recentf-max-menu-items 25)
  (global-set-key "\C-x\ \C-r" 'recentf-open-files)
#+END_SRC

** Project Management

   Let's assume that every git repo was a project, wouldn't it be
   nice to do finds and greps limited to such a project.
   This is what [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] attempts to do (see [[http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Projectile][this wiki page]]).

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'projectile)
  (projectile-global-mode) ;; to enable in all buffers
#+END_SRC

   Useful Keybindings:

   - =[C-c p f]= Find a file in the project.
   - =[C-c p g]= Find text matches in the project

   If indexing gets slow, you can cache the results.

** Auto Complete

   This feature scans the code and suggests completions for what you
   are typing. Useful at times ... annoying at others.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'auto-complete-config)
  (add-to-list 'ac-dictionary-directories "~/.emacs.d/ac-dict")
  (ac-config-default)
#+END_SRC

   Note that we specify where a dictionary lives for each specific
   language.

** Yas Snippet

   While the [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][Github project]] claims that we can install yasnippet from
   ELPA, I have found that downloading the source from github is the
   only one that actually works.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/yasnippet")
#+END_SRC

   The [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][yasnippet project]] allows me to create snippets of code that
   can be brought into a file, based on the language. 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'yasnippet)
  (require 'yasnippet-bundle)
#+END_SRC

   We load the standard libraries, but load our *special* library
   first. Note: I also grab this collection of [[https://github.com/swannodette/clojure-snippets][Clojure Snippets]].
   Inside each of these directories should be directories like
   =clojure-mode= and =org-mode=. This tells it where to find
   snippets for the current mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq yas/root-directory
        '("~/.emacs.d/snippets"            ;; personal snippets
          "~/.emacs.d/clojure-snippets"
          "~/.emacs.d/yasnippet/snippets"))

  (yas/global-mode 1)
  (yas/initialize)

  ;; The following command can be used if we change anything
  (yas/reload-all)
#+END_SRC

** Dash

   The [[http://kapeli.com/][Dash product]] looks interesting, and [[https://github.com/Kapeli/dash-at-point][this project]] allows Emacs
   to open Dash for documentation of anything with a =C-c d= keystroke:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/dash-at-point")
  (autoload 'dash-at-point "dash-at-point"
            "Search the word at point with Dash." t nil)
  (global-set-key "\C-cd" 'dash-at-point)
#+END_SRC

** Note Grep

   I use the standard [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/GrepMode#toc1][grep package]] in Emacs and wrap it so that I
   can easily search through my notes.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun ngrep (reg-exp)
    "Searches the Notes and ORG directory tree for an expression."
    (interactive "sSearch note directory for: ")
    (let ((file-ext "*.org *.md *.txt *.markdown")
          (search-dir "~/Dropbox/org"))
      (message "Searching in %s" search-dir)
      (grep-compute-defaults)
      (rgrep reg-exp file-ext search-dir)))

  (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-n" 'ngrep)
  (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-r" 'rgrep)
#+END_SRC

   Don't forget that after doing a =C-x C-f= to find a file, you can
   hit another =M-f= to do a find the given directory (and subs).

   Also, you can do a full locate with =C-x C-l=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-l" 'locate)
  (setq locate-command "mdfind")  ;; Use Mac OS X's Spotlight
#+END_SRC

** Spell Checking


   I like spell checking with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell][FlySpell]], which uses =ispell=.

   To build a dictionary hash (seems important now), do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
  buildhash ~/Dropbox/dictionary-personal.txt /opt/local/lib/english.aff ~/Dropbox/dictionary-personal.txt.hash
#+END_SRC

   Then, we can use it like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ispell-personal-dictionary
      (concat (getenv "HOME") "/Dropbox/dictionary-personal.txt"))

  (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook org-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode 1))))
#+END_SRC

   If I find any =text-mode= derived mode that I don't want to
   spell-check, then I need to use the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
  (dolist (hook '(change-log-mode-hook log-edit-mode-hook org-agenda-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode -1))))
#+END_SRC

** Miscellaneous Settings

*** IDO (Interactively DO Things)

    According to [[http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2010/10/10/introduction-to-ido-mode/][Mickey]], IDO is the greatest thing.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq ido-enable-flex-matching t)
  (setq ido-everywhere t)
  (ido-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

    I guess you can call =ido-use-url-at-point= with Markdown to jump
    to the URLs. Perhaps?

*** SMEX

    Built using [[*IDO%20(Interactively%20DO%20Things)][IDO]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
  (require 'smex)
  (smex-initialize) ; Can be omitted. This might cause a (minimal) delay

  (global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'smex)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-X") 'smex-major-mode-commands)

  ;; This is our old M-x.
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c M-x") 'execute-extended-command)
#+END_SRC

*** Backup Settings

    This setting moves all backup files to a central location.
    Got it from [[http://whattheemacsd.com/init.el-02.html][this page]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq backup-directory-alist
        `(("." . ,(expand-file-name
                   (concat user-emacs-directory "backups")))))
#+END_SRC

   Make backups of files, even when they're in version control

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq vc-make-backup-files t)
#+END_SRC

*** Line Numbers

    Let's create keystrokes to turn on/off line numbering:


    Do we want this to turn on automatically with certain modes?

*** Smart Scan

    Use the =M-n= to search the buffer for the word the cursor is
    currently pointing. =M-p= to go backwards.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (load-library "smart-scan")
#+END_SRC
* Org Mode

  The [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] feature was a big reason in my recent re-kindling of my
  Emacs love affair.

** Initial Settings

   Initialization of Org Mode by hooking it into YASnippets, which
   should allow me to easily add templates to my files.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            '(lambda ()
               (yas/minor-mode-on)))
#+END_SRC

*** Recent and Heavily Used Files

    We want both a recently seen files as well, as a top 10. This
    /Top 10/ file list can just be an Org file, right?

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun find-file-current-sprint ()
    (interactive)
    (find-file current-sprint-file))

  (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-u" 'find-file-current-sprint)
#+END_SRC

*** Org-Mode Sprint Note Files

    At the beginning of each sprint, we need to set this to the new
    sprint file.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq current-sprint "2013-POP24")
  
  (defun get-current-sprint-file ()
    (expand-file-name (concat "~/Dropbox/org/gilt/Sprint-" current-sprint ".org")))
  (defvar current-sprint-file 
    (get-current-sprint-file)
    "The name of an Org mode that stores information about the current sprint.")
  
  ;; Changed the name of the sprint? Run:   (create-sprint-file)
#+END_SRC

    When we change to a new sprint, we need to create a new Sprint
    Org File (from a template).

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun create-sprint-file ()
    "Creates a new Sprint file"
    (interactive)
    (let (today (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %a"))
      (setq template (concat "#+TITLE:  Sprint " current-sprint "\n"
                    "#+AUTHOR: Howard Abrams\n"
                    "#+EMAIL:  habrams@gilt.com\n"
                    "#+DATE:   " today "\n\n"
                    "* My Work Issues\n\n"
                    "* Sprint Retrospective\n\n"))
      (with-temp-file current-sprint-file
        (insert template)
        (message (concat "Created " current-sprint-file)))))
#+END_SRC

*** Org-Mode Colors

  Before we load =org-mode= proper, we need to set the following
  syntax high-lighting parameters. These are used to help bring out
  the source code during literate programming mode.

  This information came from [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/examples/fontify-src-code-blocks.html][these instructions]], however, they tend
  to conflict with the /color-theme/, so we'll turn them off for now.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defface org-block-begin-line
    '((t (:underline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF")))
    "Face used for the line delimiting the begin of source blocks.")
  
  (defface org-block-background
    '((t (:background "#FFFFEA")))
    "Face used for the source block background.")
  
  (defface org-block-end-line
    '((t (:overline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF")))
    "Face used for the line delimiting the end of source blocks.")
#+END_SRC

** Library Loading

   The standard package manager (and most recent versions of Emacs)
   include =org-mode=, however, I want the latest version that has
   specific features for literate programming.

   Org-mode is installed in the global directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/org/lisp")
  (require 'org)
  ; (require 'org-install)
  (require 'ob-tangle)
#+END_SRC

** Global Key Bindings for Org-Mode

   The =org-mode= has some useful keybindings that are helpful no
   matter what mode you are using currently.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
  (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
  (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
#+END_SRC

** Speed Keys

   If point is at the beginning of a headline or code block in
   org-mode, single keys do fun things. See =org-speed-command-help=
   for details (or hit the ? key at a headline).

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-use-speed-commands t)
#+END_SRC

** Specify the Org Directories

   I keep all my =org-mode= files in a few directories, and I would
   like them automatically searched when I generate agendas.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/org/personal" 
                         "~/Dropbox/org/gilt" 
                         "~/Dropbox/org/lg" 
                         "~/Dropbox/org/rpg" 
                         "~/Dropbox/org/project"))
#+END_SRC

** Auto Note Capturing

   Let's say you were in the middle of something, but would like to
   /take a quick note/, but without affecting the file you are
   working on. This is called a "capture", and is bound to the
   following key:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (define-key global-map "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
#+END_SRC

   This will bring up a list of /note capturing templates/:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(("t" "Thought or Note" plain (file "~/Dropbox/org/notes/GTD Thoughts.txt")
           "  * %i%?\n    %a")
          ("d" "General TODO Tasks" entry (file "~/Dropbox/org/notes/GTD Tasks.org")

  ;; General notes go into this file:
  (setq org-default-notes-file "~/Dropbox/org/notes/GTD Tasks.org")
#+END_SRC

   After you have selected the template, you type in your note and hit
   =C-c C-c= to store it in the file listed above.

   Just remember, at some point to hit =C-c C-w= to /refile/ that note
   in the appropriate place.

*** RSS Feeds to Notes

    A cool feature allows me to automatically take the tasks assigned
    to me during a Sprint, and create entries for me to add my
    personal notes and comments.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-feed-alist
        (list (list "Gilt Jira"
          "https://jira.gilt.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/15717/SearchRequest-15717.xml"
          (get-current-sprint-file) "My Work Issues")))
  (setq org-feed-default-template "** %h\n   %a")
  ;; We really want to change the %h to %( replace ... \"%h\" and \"%a\" )
  ;; %(concat \"[[\%a][\" (substring \"%h\" 1) \"]\")
#+END_SRC

    To regen the list, hit: =C-c C-x g=

** Checking Things Off

   When I check off an item as done, sometimes I want to add some
   details about the completion (this is really only helpful when I'm
   consulting). 

   With this setting, each time you turn an entry from a TODO state
   into the DONE state, a line 'CLOSED: [timestamp]' will be inserted
   just after the headline. If you turn the entry back into a TODO
   item through further state cycling, that line will be removed
   again.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ; (setq org-log-done 'time)
  (setq org-log-done 'note)
#+END_SRC

** Org Publishing

   The brilliance of =org-mode= is the ability to publish your notes
   as HTML files into a web server. See [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html][these instructions]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'org-publish)
  
  (setq org-publish-project-alist  '(
    ("org-notes"
     :base-directory        "~/Dropbox/org/"

     :recursive            f
     :publishing-function   org-publish-org-to-html
     :auto-preamble         t

     :makeindex             f
     :section-numbers       nil
     :table-of-contents     nil
     )

    ("org-static"

     :publishing-directory "~/Sites/"
     :recursive            t
     :publishing-function  org-publish-attachment
     )
  
    ("all" :components ("org-notes" "org-static" "dot-files"))))
#+END_SRC

   I really, really would like to affect the output of the
   exported/published HTML files to make them /prettier/.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-export-html-style "<link rel='stylesheet' href='http://www.howardism.org/styles/org-export-html-style.css' type='text/css'/>
  <script src='http://use.edgefonts.net/source-sans-pro.js'></script>
  <script src='http://use.edgefonts.net/source-code-pro.js'></script>")
#+END_SRC

*** Default Export Settings

    To make the =org-mode= export defaults closer to my liking
    (without having to put specific #+PROPERTY commands), start by
    =describe-variable= the =org-export-plist-vars= variable.

    This returns the list of variables that can be customized:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-export-with-section-numbers nil)
  (setq org-export-with-toc nil)
  (setq org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading nil)

  (setq org-export-html-postamble nil) ;; We don't need any gunk at end

  ; (setq org-export-creator-info nil)
  ; (setq org-export-email-info nil)
  ; (setq org-export-author-info nil)
  ; (setq org-export-time-stamp-file nil)
  ; (setq org-export-html-with-timestamp nil)
#+END_SRC

*** Publishing as Presentation

    Out of all [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/non-beamer-presentations.html][the ideas]] online, I prefer using [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][S5]], and by loading
    [[https://github.com/eschulte/org-S5/blob/master/org-export-as-s5.el][this code]], we can issue =org-export-as-s5=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (load-library "org-export-as-s5")
#+END_SRC

    And let's tie this to a keystroke to make it easier to use:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> p") 'org-export-as-s5)
#+END_SRC

*** Publish as Markdown

    Using the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-export-generic.php][org-export-generic]] feature, we can export to Markdown
    using =C-c C-e g M=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'org-export-generic)
(org-set-generic-type
 "Markdown" 
 '(:file-suffix ".markdown"
   :key-binding ?M
   :title-format "%s\n"
   :title-suffix ?=
   :body-header-section-numbers t
   :body-header-section-number-format "%s) "
   :body-section-header-prefix	("\n## " "\n### " "\n#### " "\n##### " "\n###### ")
   :body-section-header-format	"%s"
   :body-section-header-suffix "\n\n"
   :todo-keywords-export t
   :body-line-format "  %s\n"
   :body-tags-export	t
   :body-tags-prefix	" <tags>"
   :body-tags-suffix	"</tags>\n"
   ;;:body-section-prefix	"<secprefix>\n"

   ))
#+END_SRC

** The Tower of Babel

   The trick to literate programming is in the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Babel project]], which
   allows org-mode to not only interpret source code blocks, but
   evaluate them and tangle them out to a file.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((sh         . t)
   (js         . t)
   (emacs-lisp . t)
   (scala      . t)
   (clojure    . t)
   (dot        . t)
   (css        . t)
   (plantuml   . t)))
#+END_SRC

   It seems to automatically recognize the language used in a source
   block, but if not, call =org-babel-lob-ingest= to add all the
   languages from the code block into the list that Babel supports.
   Keystroke: =C-c C-v i=.

*** Font Coloring in Code Blocks
    
    Normally, fontifying the individual code blocks makes it
    impossible to work with, so instead of turning it on at the global
    level for all blocks, I created a couple of keystrokes to
    selectively colorize one block at a time.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ; (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
  
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> g") 'org-src-fontify-buffer)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> f") 'org-src-fontify-block)
#+END_SRC
* Programming Languages
** Clojure

   Me like Clojure, and since it is a LISP, then Emacs likes it too.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'clojure-mode)

  (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook
            '(lambda ()
               (yas/minor-mode-on)))
#+END_SRC

   Most LISP-based programming is better with rainbow ponies:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
#+END_SRC

   With the =elein= project installed, it allows us to do things
   like: =M-x elein-run-cmd koan run=

   The following makes [[https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki][Compojure]] macro calls look better:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (define-clojure-indent
    (defroutes 'defun)
    (GET 2)
    (POST 2)
    (PUT 2)
    (DELETE 2)
    (HEAD 2)
    (ANY 2)
    (context 2))
#+END_SRC

   Really want to try out my new [[file:~/Dropbox/Clojure/clojuredocs-emacs/org/clojuredocs.org][ClojureDocs functions]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (load-library "clojuredocs")
#+END_SRC

   Usage:

   - =nrepl-jack-in= - For executing regular expressions with nREPL
   - =nrepl-ritz-jack-in= - For debugging expressions with Ritz
   - =nrepl-enable-on-existing-clojure-buffers= for Clojure buffers
     opened prior to starting up the nREPL interface.

*** Paredit

    One of the cooler features of Emacs is the [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit][ParEdit mode]] which
    keeps all parenthesis balanced in Lisp-oriented languages.
    See this [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PareditCheatsheet][cheatsheet]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (autoload 'paredit-mode "paredit"
    "Minor mode for pseudo-structurally editing Lisp code." t)
#+END_SRC

    We need to associate specific language modes with ParEdit.
    We first create a helper function:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun turn-on-paredit () (paredit-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

    Then associate the following Lisp-based modes with ParEdit:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook       'turn-on-paredit)
  (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook             'turn-on-paredit)
  (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'turn-on-paredit)
  (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook           'turn-on-paredit)
  (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook          'turn-on-paredit)
#+END_SRC

    Without the helpful functions, we would have to do something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
  (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook          (lambda () (paredit-mode +1)))
#+END_SRC

*** ElDoc

    Need to get [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ElDoc][ElDoc]] working with Clojure.

** Scala

   We need to load the [[https://github.com/haxney/scala-mode][scala mode]].
   We follow [[http://www.scala-lang.org/node/354][these instructions]] to hook it up with [[http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/][Yasnippet]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'scala-mode)
  
  ;; Shouldn't this be done by default?
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.scala$" . scala-mode))
  
  (add-hook 'scala-mode-hook
            '(lambda ()
               (yas/minor-mode-on)
               (scala-mode-feature-electric-mode)))
#+END_SRC

   We follow [[http://jawher.net/2011/01/17/scala-development-environment-emacs-sbt-ensime/][these instructions]] to set it up with [[https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime][Ensime]].
   Ensime is not available as a package, so I had to download and
   install it, so we need to add it to the =load-path=.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/ensime/elisp")
  (require 'ensime)
  (add-hook 'scala-mode-hook 'ensime-scala-mode-hook)
#+END_SRC

** JavaScript

   JavaScript should have three parts:
   - Syntax highlight (already included)
   - Syntax verification (with flymake-jshint)
   - Interactive REPL

   Why yes, it seems that the JavaScript mode has a special
   indentation setting. Go below?

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq js-basic-indent 2)

  (setq js2-basic-offset 2)
  (setq js2-cleanup-whitespace t)
  (setq js2-enter-indents-newline t)
  (setq js2-global-externs "jQuery $")
  (setq js2-indent-on-enter-key t)
  (setq js2-mode-indent-ignore-first-tab t)

  (autoload 'js2-mode "js2-mode" nil t)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.js$" . js2-mode))
#+END_SRC

   Change the word "function" to just an "f":

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (font-lock-add-keywords
   'js2-mode `(("\\(function *\\)("
               (0 (progn (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "ƒ")
                         nil)))))
#+END_SRC

   Place warning font around TODO and others:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (font-lock-add-keywords 'js2-mode
                          '(("\\<\\(FIX\\|TODO\\|FIXME\\|HACK\\|REFACTOR\\):"
                             1 font-lock-warning-face t)))
#+END_SRC

*** FlyMake and JSHint

   While editing JavaScript is baked into Emacs, it is kinda cool to
   have it give you red sections based on [[http://www.jshint.com/][jshint]].
   This is done with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlymakeJavaScript][FlyMake]].

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Make sure that PATH can reference the 'jshint' executable:
  (setenv "PATH" (concat "/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:" (getenv "PATH")))
  (setq exec-path '( "/usr/local/bin" "/usr/bin" "/opt/local/bin" "/bin"
                     (concat (getenv "HOME") "/bin")))
  
  (require 'flymake-jshint)
  (add-hook 'js-mode-hook
            (lambda () (flymake-mode 1)))
#+END_SRC

   Now load and edit a JavaScript file, like [[file:~/jshint-code-test.js][jshint-code-test.js]].

*** JavaScript REPL

    We can use two different approaches for a JavaScript REPL.
    *Note:* Neither are working very effectively.

**** Client JS with MozRepl

     Assuming you have Mozilla Firefox running with the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozrepl/][MozRepl]]
     add-on and you've installed a =moz= executable:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
  (autoload 'moz-minor-mode "moz" "Mozilla Minor and Inferior Mozilla Modes" t)
  
  (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'javascript-custom-setup)
  (defun javascript-custom-setup ()
    (moz-minor-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

     This gives you the following commands:

     - C-c C-s: open a MozRepl interaction buffer and switch to it
     - C-c C-l: save the current buffer and load it in MozRepl
     - C-M-x: send the current function (as recognized by c-mark-function) to MozRepl
     - C-c C-c: send the current function to MozRepl and switch to the interaction buffer
     - C-c C-r: send the current region to MozRepl

**** Server JS with Node.js

    We use [[http://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net][js-comint]], but hook it up with node.js:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'js-comint)
  (setenv "NODE_NO_READLINE" "1")   ;; Turn off fancy node prompt
  ;; Use node as our repl
  (setq inferior-js-program-command "node")
#+END_SRC

    According to [[http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_repl][these instructions]], we set the =NODE_NO_READLINE=
    variable.

    Need some prompt configuration for the REPL:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq inferior-js-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
          ;; We like nice colors
          (ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on)
          ;; Deal with some prompt nonsense
          (add-to-list
           'comint-preoutput-filter-functions
           (lambda (output)
             (replace-regexp-in-string "\033\\[[0-9]+[GK]" "" output)
             (replace-regexp-in-string ".*1G.*3G" "&GT;" output)
             (replace-regexp-in-string "&GT;" "> " output)
  ))))
#+END_SRC

    Now, we can start up a JavaScript node REPL: =run-js=

    Let's test this out by loading this into a separate buffer (=C-c '=)
    and then doing a =M-x send-buffer-and-go=.

    Set up some helpful keyboard instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook
          (lambda () 
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-x C-e") #'js-send-buffer-and-go)
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-x r")   #'run-js)))
#+END_SRC

    Wanna try it all out?

#+BEGIN_SRC js2 :tangle no
  function factorial(n) { 
    return n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
  factorial(16);
#+END_SRC

** Java
*** JSP

    Dealing with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/JspMode][JSP files]] is bad. But we'll try the [[http://www.crossleys.org/~jim/work/jsp.el][jsp-mode]] first:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    ; (autoload 'jsp-mode "jsp" "JSP" t)

    ; Tell emacs to use jsp-mode for .jsp files
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.jsp\\'" . html-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Tools
** Git

   Git is [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Git][already part of Emacs]]. However, [[http://philjackson.github.com/magit/magit.html][Magit]] is sweet.
   
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
  (require 'magit)
  (define-key global-map "\M-\C-g" 'magit-status)
#+END_SRC

** Markdown

   Don't use Markdown nearly as much as I used to, but I'm surprised
   that the following extension-associations aren't the default:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (autoload 'markdown-mode "markdown-mode.el"
     "Major mode for editing Markdown files" t)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.txt\\'" . markdown-mode))
#+END_SRC   

** Mail with Gnus

   I would like to hook up my [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail][Gmail with GNUS mail reader]].
   See these [[http://www.mostlymaths.net/2010/12/emacs-30-day-challenge-using-gnus-to.html][detailed instructions]] if we run into problems.
   The instructions are contained in [[file:gnus.org][gnus.org]] file.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (load-library "gnus-config")
#+END_SRC

** Reading Mail?

   Well, Gnus is pretty gunky. It works, but ...

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
(autoload 'vm "~/vm" "Start VM on your primary inbox." t)
(autoload 'vm-visit-folder "~/vm" "Start VM on an arbitrary folder." t)
(autoload 'vm-mail "~/vm" "Send a mail message using VM." t)
(autoload 'vm-submit-bug-report "~/vm" "Send a bug report about VM." t)
#+END_SRC
* Final Thoughts

  Order sometimes matter, and this section is specially applied at
  the end of the file.

** Overriding Keybindings

   You would think that you could just set the keybindings you want
   at the top of your file, and be good, but since modules like to
   add their own binding, I want to override some of them:

   Rebind =C-x C-y= to the Yas expand function:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-y" 'yas/expand)
#+END_SRC

* Technical Artifacts

  Before you can build this on a new system, make sure that you put
  the cursor over any of these properties, and hit: =C-c C-c=
